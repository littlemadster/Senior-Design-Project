Senior Design Project - 360 Degree Wheelchair Sensor System 

This code immitates a 360 Degree Wheelchair Sensor System in which 8 ultrasonic sensors sense any obstructions around the wheelchair user. Since
the acutal code for the system would not run unless attached to the sensors, this code is how it would run with a random generation of data distances
for the 8 sensors.

This project was sponsored by Jabil during Fall 2021 - Spring 2022 while I was attending Florida Polytechnic University.
